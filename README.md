## Introduction

The LCS Unity Project is a simple Unity application that demonstrates the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm. It is a great way to learn about both Unity and algorithm design.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lcsUnity.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Play the scene to see the LCS algorithm in action.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Visualize the LCS algorithm step-by-step.
- **Customizable Input**: Enter your own sequences to find the LCS.
- **Educational**: Learn about the LCS algorithm and how it works.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository and open it in Unity:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lcsUnity.git
```

## Usage

Once you have the project open in Unity, you can run the scene to see the LCS algorithm in action. Use the UI to enter your own sequences and visualize the results.
